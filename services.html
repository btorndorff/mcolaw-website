                            Virginians are hard-working people that try to meet their obligations, but sometimes events
                            happen such as injury, divorce or layoffs that make bankruptcy the only choice available.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We have over 25 years experience in bankruptcy practice that includes Chapter 7, Chapter 13
                            reorganization and Chapter 11 personal and business bankruptcies. See, In re: Townside
